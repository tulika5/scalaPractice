/* object Main inherits the main method of App trait.
args is like String(args[])
app is a helper boilerplate code provided by scala
a trait is like interface of java, but it can have partial implementation also
*/

        println("dude, please give your name")
    }
	else
	{ val name = args(0)
	println("hello",name)}

/*1. Is scala object oriented or functional programming language?
Both
Everything is object e.g. function and integers are objects
Every function is a value in Scala, thatâ€™s simply mean you can use a function anywhere you can use a value.
*/

/*is scala statically typed?
Yes
Advantage: type checking happens at compile time
Java is also statically typed,  but scala has type inference also :D
